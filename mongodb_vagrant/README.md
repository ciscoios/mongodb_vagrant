In this lab we'll create a MongoDb database with collections users and add user to a created database.
To complete this lab we need vagrant, virtualbox installed.

Useful commands:
#run vagrant and provision our setup
vagrant up
#If VM is already provisioned we can use the following command
vagrant up --provision

#Destroy created VM
vagrant destroy
